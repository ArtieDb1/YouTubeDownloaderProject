# YouTube Downloader

## Background
###### Please note that this project isn't for the illegal downloading of copyright videos but to learn how an API works and download one's videos with the strict permission of the owner. I am not responsible for any illegal use of this tool. The following background is completely fictional and is only there to show the hypothetical use of my project.

My parents have a very unique music taste and really enjoy having listening to music from their home country that isn't available on spotify.
Growing up, I was shown how to use YouTube downloaders before spotify (legally). Unfortunately, with the rise of music streaming platforms, companies have began to charge exhorbitant fees to listen to music in a way that emulates the once-popular MP3 player. YouTube has taken to that trend too meaning that free podcasts and very unpopular music are now ridden with ads and force the user to have to stay in the app to stream at their desires.
Seeing the struggle that my parents endured with this inconvenient way of listening to music, I recommended the aforementioned youtube downloaders. I was completely unaware that a accessing reliable downloader would require either a payment or a careful traversal through a mine-field of virus-ridden websites that my parents just didnt have the ability to avoid. So I built my own one.

# Introduction

In this project, I interracted with youtube using Googles API keys to get the details of a YouTube Video. I then used some Java libraries to download my own video and extract the audio. The final step was creating GUI for the user to interract with.
